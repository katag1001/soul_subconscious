              Emotional safety isn’t something we find outside of ourselves — it’s something
              we learn to cultivate within through small, steady practices.
            </p>

            <p>
              Begin with simple agreements: name one thing you will give yourself today
              (rest, a pause, a kind word). Over time these tiny promises signal to your
              nervous system that it is safe to soften.
            </p>

            <p>
              If an old habit arises, try a gentle question: “What does this part of me need?”
              Often curiosity, rather than fixing, is the first step toward feeling safer.
